# My Personal Website
Welcome to the repository for my personal website! This project is the culmination of my journey in web development, which I embarked on with no prior experience. Through self-teaching, determination, and a passion for learning, I have designed and built this website from scratch.

My [Website](https://adamshepherd36.github.io/)
contains a simple website project designed to showcase my skills in HTML and to provide an online portfolio of my other projects or feel free to [View](https://github.com/Adamshepherd36/Data-Analysis-Portfolio) my project from my Github account.

This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.

## About the Project
This website is a reflection of my skills, creativity, and what I have learned about web design and development. It includes various sections that showcase who I am, my work, and the projects I've completed. The site is fully responsive, meaning it looks great on all devices, from desktops to smartphones.

### Key Features:
- Responsive Design: The website adapts to different screen sizes, providing a seamless user experience on any device.
- Clean and Modern UI: I focused on creating a clean, modern interface that is both visually appealing and user-friendly.
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: The site is built using these core web technologies. I have implemented various features and interactivity using JavaScript.
- Self-Taught Development: I learned everything needed to build this website through online resources, tutorials, and hands-on practice.

## Challenges Overcome
Throughout this project, I encountered and overcame various challenges, including:
- Learning the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript from scratch.
- Understanding and applying responsive design principles.
- Debugging issues and ensuring cross-browser compatibility.
- Implementing interactivity and animations.

### What I Learned
- This project has been a tremendous learning experience. I gained a solid understanding of web development fundamentals, improved my problem-solving skills, and learned how to approach new challenges with confidence. The process has been incredibly rewarding, and Iâ€™m excited to continue learning and improving.

### Future Improvements
While I am proud of what I have accomplished so far, I am always looking for ways to improve. In the future, I plan to:
- Add more advanced features and functionality using JavaScript and other libraries.
- Explore backend development to create dynamic content.
- Continuously refine and update the design based on feedback and new trends.
